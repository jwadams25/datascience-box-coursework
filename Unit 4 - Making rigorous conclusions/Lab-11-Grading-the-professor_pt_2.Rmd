### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
```

### Exercise 1

```{r data }
glimpse(evals)
```

### Exercise 2

Fit a linear model (one you have fit before): score_bty_fit, predicting average professor evaluation score based on average beauty rating (bty_avg) only. Write the linear model, and note the R2 and the adjusted R2.


score = 3.88 + 0.06664 x bty_avg

Multiple R-squared:  0.03502,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.03293 


```{r score bty}
score_bty_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals) %>%
  tidy()

score_bty_fit

summary(lm(formula = evals$score ~ evals$bty_avg))
```
